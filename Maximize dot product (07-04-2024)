//Explanation:
//1) Function Definition: This line defines a function maxDotProduct that takes four arguments: n and m which represent the sizes of arrays a and b respectively, and the arrays a and b.
//2) Dynamic Programming Matrix Initialization: This code initializes a 2D array dp of size (m+1) x (n+1) and initializes all its elements to zero using memset. This array will be used for dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
//3) Dynamic Programming Loop:
//> This nested loop iterates over i from 1 to m, and for each i, it iterates over j from i to n.
//> For each i and j, it calculates the maximum dot product using dynamic programming.
//> dp[i][j] stores the maximum dot product considering elements up to index j from array a and up to index i from array b.
//> The maximum dot product for the current i and j is calculated by either including the current elements from both arrays a and b ((dp[i-1][j-1] + (a[j-1] * b[i-1]))), or by excluding the current element from array a (dp[i][j-1]).
//4) Return Result: Finally, the maximum dot product calculated for the entire arrays a and b is returned as the result.
