//Approach:
//1) Calculate the total number of elements in each matrix.
//2) Initialize left pointer to the start of mat1 and right pointer to the end of mat2.
//3) Initialize a counter for pairs.
//4) Iterate until left pointer is within bounds and right pointer is within bounds.
//5) Calculate the sum of the elements at positions pointed by left and right pointers.
//6) If the sum equals x, increment both pointers and counter.
//7) If the sum is greater than x, decrement the right pointer.
//8) If the sum is less than x, increment the left pointer.
//9) Return the count of pairs whose sum equals x.
